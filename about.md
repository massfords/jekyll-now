My name is Mark Ford and I'm a software engineer in the Greater Boston Area. I've worked mostly at software product companies for the last 20 years and recently I've been working as a Graduate Teaching Assistant at The Harvard Extension School.

I learned Test Driven Development and JUnit in 2000 from an Object Mentor seminar with Kent Beck. I always believe there's time to do things the right way since otherwise you wind up doing them twice (or more).
