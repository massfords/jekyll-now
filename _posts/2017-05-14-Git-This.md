title: Git Alias for initializing your repo
---

Great tip from a colleague for setting up your git repo for [git flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). This 
is designed to be run on a brand new project folder before you start adding
source code. It will initialize git and ensure that you're on the develop 
branch to begin your work. Nothing elaborate, just a nice alias that I don't
want to lose track of when setting up a new machine.

```
[alias]
        this = !git init && git commit --allow-empty -m \"Initialize Git Repo\" && git checkout -b develop && git add . && git commit -m \"Initial Commit\"
```

Add the above snippet into ~/.gitconfig
